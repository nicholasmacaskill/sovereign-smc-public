This reveals a lack of understanding regarding Time & Price Theory, specifically the four quartiles and their role in manipulation. A 0 Time Alignment suggests you're entering blindly without considering session or intraweek timing. The bullish bias is not enough; precision demands exploitation of the Manipulation phase (Q2) after Accumulation (Q1). Furthermore, a 'stable' reading on Whale Movements is too vague. Is there evidence of accumulation BEFORE your entry zone, or simply 'stability'? A 1.0 Institutional Sponsor strength indicates a potential SMT divergence *IF* it is occurring between correlated assets like ETH. Provide concrete evidence of this divergence. 'Potential' is not enough, show me the disparity.","status":"PENDING"},{"id":15,"timestamp":"2026-01-06T18:10:00+00:00","symbol":"BTC/USDT","timeframe":"5m","pattern":"Stress Test Force Trigger","bias":"BULLISH","ai_score":0.0,"ai_reasoning":"AI Error: 404 models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent.
