# 👁️ THE SOVEREIGN SYSTEM MANIFESTO
### *Automated ICT Institutional Flow & Multi-Modal Validation*

The Sovereign SMC system is not a retail bot. It is an automated institutional gatekeeper designed to extract capital from the market using the core principles of Inner Circle Trader (ICT) mentorships, reinforced by multi-asset confluence and Multimodal AI Vision.

## 🛡️ CORE ICT PROTOCOLS
The system tracks the movement of Smart Money by monitoring the interaction between Price and Time.

- **Killzone Synchronization**: Operates exclusively during the **NY Session (7:00 AM - 15:00 EST)**. Outside of this window, the system is dormant to avoid low-liquidity "retail noise."
- **PO3 & Judas Swings**: Identifies **Power of 3** (Accumulation -> Manipulation -> Distribution). It specifically hunts for the **Judas Swing** (false move) that sweeps liquidity before the true trend begins.
- **Displacement Engine**: Scans for **Fair Value Gaps (FVG)** and "Long Body" candles. A setup is only valid if it shows true institutional displacement.
- **Bi-Directional Bias**: Leverages the **4H Timeframe** to determine the daily narrative, ensuring intraday trades align with the institutional "Large Order Flow."

## 🌐 THE TRINITY OF SPONSORSHIP (CROSS-MARKET)
No move in BTC happens in a vacuum. The `IntermarketEngine` tracks the correlation between asset classes:

- **US Dollar Index (DXY)**: Validates moves against Dollar strength. Bullish setups require DXY weakness.
- **Treasury Yields (10Y TNX)**: Monitors the bond market. Rising yields flag a "Risk-Off" environment that can kill crypto expansion.
- **Equity Confluence (NQ/ES)**: Tracks Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures. Institutional risk appetite must be synchronized across indices for high-probability setups.
- **SMT Divergence**: Automatically detects divergences between the Trinity members (e.g., NQ sweeps a high while BTC doesn't), signaling the true direction of the smart money.

---

## 📊 INSTITUTIONAL DEPTH (LEVEL 2)
The system looks beneath the surface of the price chart using the **Binance Order Book (L2)**:

- **Absorption Filter**: When a liquidity sweep occurs, the system scans the order book for "Walls" of institutional money (at least **5.0 BTC** of resting limit orders).
- **Retail Bait Detection**: If a sweep happens without significant order book depth, the system flags it as "Dust" and rejects the trade.

## 👁️ THE GLASS EYE (AI VISION)
The final gatekeeper is a **Gemini 2.0 Flash Multimodal Pipeline**:

- **Automated Charting**: Generates high-fidelity OHLC charts with Asian/London range overlays and trade levels.
- **Visual Inspection**: The AI "sees" the chart like a human mentor. It inspects:
    - **Wick Displacement**: Are the wicks long and aggressive?
    - **FVG Respect**: Is price bouncing off the FVG or slicing through it?
    - **Narrative Vibe**: Does the chart "look" institutional or like retail bait?

---

## 🚦 SAFETY & RISK MANAGEMENT
- **News Blackout**: Automatically pauses 30 minutes before/after **High-Impact (Red Folder)** USD news releases using the ForexFactory calendar.
- **Sentiment Confluence**: Integrates the **Fear & Green Index**, **CryptoPanic news sentiment**, and **Whale Alert** large transaction flows.
- **Sovereign Score**: Every setup is assigned a 0-10 score. Only setups scoring **> 7.5** (Verified Institutional Flow) are alerted to Telegram.
